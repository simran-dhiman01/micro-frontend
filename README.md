# Micro-Frontend Architecture

This repository contains a **Micro-Frontend Architecture** built using **React** and **Vite Module Federation**.  
It showcases modular application design, reusability, and communication between multiple independently developed micro-frontends.

###  [Live Email app](https://email-app-mfe.vercel.app/)
###  [Live Chat app](https://micro-frontend-pi.vercel.app/)


## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and implement a scalable micro-frontend system with three main parts:

| Application | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| **Host App** | Main Application | Serves as the shell/wrapper for all micro-frontends. Manages layout, routing, and shared design system. |
| **Chat App** | Micro-Frontend | A standalone application responsible for chat functionality (sending and receiving messages). |
| **Email App** | Micro-Frontend | A standalone application responsible for email management (viewing and composing emails). |

Each app can run **independently** or be **dynamically integrated** into the host using **Module Federation**.

---

## Key Features 

### Micro-Frontend Architecture
- Implemented using **Vite + @originjs/vite-plugin-federation**.
- Each micro-app runs independently with its own build and deploy process.
- The Host dynamically loads and renders the Chat and Email apps at runtime.

### Shared Design System
- A **centralized design system** is defined in the Host app.
- Shared components (`Card`, `Button`, `Input`) and a common **theme** ensure consistent UI across micro-apps.

### Communication Between Applications
- Used **Custom Events** for communication.
- Chat app can send messages to the Host, and the Host can send responses back to the Chat app.

### Scalability & Modularity
- Architecture supports easy addition of future micro-apps (e.g., Dashboard, Analytics).
- Each app has isolated code and dependencies, reducing coupling and improving maintainability.

```
## Key Architectural Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Micro-Frontend Framework
- **Decision:** Used **Vite Module Federation** (`@originjs/vite-plugin-federation`)
- **Reasoning:** Enables dynamic loading of independent micro-apps (Chat, Email) within a single Host application.
- **Trade-off:** Slightly less mature ecosystem compared to Webpack‚Äôs Module Federation

---

### 2. Build Tool
- **Decision:** **Vite**
- **Reasoning:** Offers lightning-fast development with hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.
- **Trade-off:** Some advanced Module Federation setups may need manual configuration.

---

### 3. Communication Mechanism
- **Decision:** Used **Browser Custom Events**
- **Reasoning:** Provides a simple, framework-agnostic way for Host and Micro-Apps to exchange data without tight coupling.
- **Trade-off:** Not persistent, not ideal for complex or multi-user real-time systems.

---

### 4. Design System Ownership
- **Decision:** Centralized the **Design System** inside the **Host Application**
- **Reasoning:** Ensures consistent UI, theme, and reusable components across all micro-frontends.
- **Trade-off:** Micro-apps depend on the host for design updates.

---

### 7. Scalability Strategy
- **Decision:** **Isolated Builds + Shared Design System**
- **Reasoning:** Each micro-app can be built, deployed, or versioned independently.
- **Trade-off:** Managing dependency versions across multiple apps increases maintenance.
